(b)
A total of 9 commits have been done to the repository at this point. The git
command used to get this information is as follows:
$ git rev-list --all --count

(c)
The file .gitignore was last modified Wed Sep 27 2017 at 16:31:42. This 
information was retrieved using the following command in the Assignment 1
directory of the repository:
$ git log .gitignore

(d)
The IDs of the commits used to merge the changes from the branch development
to the branch master are as follows:
commit 36a8e55e4bbdd171ab57d979e1a802d740f2db9b
commit cb30d72a3d94c108f393c163a35c1cc9bf18ffca

(e)
One reason for using a branch in a Git repository is to provide an environment 
for a developer to make changes to code and verify those changes work before 
they are delivered to another developer. Another reason for using a branch 
is to allow modularization of development, meaning developers can work on 
different features of a software system simultaneously.

(f)
The command "git log" provides information about the latest commits to the 
repository, while the command "git status" provides information on the current 
working branch of the project tree. The command "git status" displays 
changes made in the working branch that differ from the main branch, while 
"git log" displays information on the commits from both the main and working 
branches.

(g)
The command you would use to see the commits where "Weapon.h" was one of the 
committed files would be as follows:
$ git log --full-history Weapon.h

(h)
The command you would use to see the commits whose commit message contains the
word "file" would be as follows:
$ git log --grep="file"

(I)
Inheritance, in object oriented programming, is the property of a class to be 
able to take on the properties of a parent class while having properties 
that are specific to its class. The parent class essentially forms a base 
for other classes. For example, a dog is a mammal but not all mammal's are 
necessarily a dog. The dog could be the sub class, inheriting properties of the 
base class and the base class can be the parent of several sub classes.
(II)
Polymorphism, in object oriented programming, is the ability to provide similar 
functionality for objects differing in class or datatype. Polymorphism allows 
several different types of objects or classes to be used in a given situation, 
such as allowing differnt classes of objects to be passed into a function.
(III)
Encapsulation, in object oriented programming, is the idea of combining data 
and functions into a single object to be used throughout a program or 
programs. The template of this object is often called a class. Encapsulation 
allows the designer to restrict access to certain data and functions of the 
class and helps define how that object is to be used.
